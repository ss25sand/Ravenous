This is an app that allows you to quickly find businesses near you.

## Project description
This app is developed in Kotlin with google play location services, square moshi and retrofit. This app also features a recommendation service written in Python with Flask, CherryPy, and PySpark that recommends relevant businesses to users with the use of collaborative filtering with the alternating least squares matrix factorization algorithm that collectively analyses previous visits, reviews, and ratings.
